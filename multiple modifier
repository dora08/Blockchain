Definition: Multiple modifiers in Solidity allow you to apply more than one modifier to a function. This means a function can be subject to multiple conditions or checks before execution.
Certainly:

Advantages:
- Modularity: Allows breaking down complex conditions into smaller, reusable parts.
- Reusability: Enables the reuse of modifiers across multiple functions or contracts.
- Enhanced Security: Provides a layered approach to security by enforcing multiple checks.

Disadvantages:
- Complexity: Increases code complexity, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- Gas Costs: Each modifier adds gas overhead, potentially increasing transaction costs.
- Potential Conflicts: Risk of conflicts or unintended interactions between multiple modifiers, requiring careful consideration.
