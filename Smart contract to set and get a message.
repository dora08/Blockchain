"Set" and "get" are common operations in programming that refer to storing and retrieving data. In the context of a smart contract to set and get a message, it means writing a piece of information (a message) to the blockchain and then being able to retrieve that information later.


pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract Message {
    string message;
    
    constructor (string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
    
    function setMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
    
    function getMessage() public view returns(string memory) {
        return message;
    }
}
