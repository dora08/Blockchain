"Set" and "get" are common operations in programming that refer to storing and retrieving data. In the context of a smart contract to set and get a message, it means writing a piece of information (a message) to the blockchain and then being able to retrieve that information later.
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into code. They run on a blockchain network, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Solidity is a popular programming language used to write smart contracts, particularly on the Ethereum blockchain.

pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract Message {
    string message;
    
    constructor (string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
    
    function setMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
    
    function getMessage() public view returns(string memory) {
        return message;
    }
}
